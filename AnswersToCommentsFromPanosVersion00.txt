L146: You mention that the start time is estimated efficiently for the top 50% Pb-Pb collisions.Why not also above? I could imagine problems with the very peripheral bins (e.g. above 90%) butbetween 50 and 80% I would naively expect little to no problems. What am I missing?

Answer: You're absolutely right. It does indeed go up to 80%. I fixed the text accordingly.

L218: You write here that the PID for the daughters is applied using the TPC info in the entire pTrange. Is this really true? Also for Λ you only use the TPC to identify the proton? I guess this isthen only in the very low pT region e.g. below 1GeV/c of the proton?

Answer:
We used 3 sigma TPC cleanup for both pions of K0s and also both proton and pion for lambdas, which is independent of pT. However if I recall correctly, this “cleanup” is effectively happening more in low pt while in higher pt, everything overlaps and majority particles having low num. sigmas difference.
Perhaps it should be noted, in addition, the track is rejected if it does not have “Valid/Correct” PID info in PIDResponse according to Twiki: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/ALICE/PIDInAnalysis#Checking_PID_status


In the twiki page (https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/ALICE/V0reconstruction), you can find two QA plots with Proton daughters in Lambda (please note that this does not include anti-p in anti-Λ) after ALL selection and before ALL cuts (so the difference is not exclusively due to only PID cut, but all reconstruction cuts).
________________________________________________________________________________________________
L293-294: It can’t be that you checked the pile-up contribution by removing the pileuprequirement, right? Can it be that you simply made the selection stricter?

Answer: Good question. The pileup rejection was used as a systematic source only in the case of non-central collisions (>20%) where this strict pile-up rejection cut was not required.

L339-343: I would find a paper to cite where the centrality dependence of triangularity (ε3) isdiscussed. I would also expand the discussion of the result by making the connection betweenv5,32 vs centrality and to how ε2 and ε3 depend on centrality


Answer: I added the citation as proposed and I elaborated further in the same paragraph about the dependence of ε3 on centrality.
The paragraph now reads: 
"Figure 3 presents the non-linear term for the fifth order flow coefficient, i.e. v5,32(pT), of p, K, p+p¯,Λ+Λ¯ and K0S for the same range of centrality intervals, i.e. 0-60%. Statistical precision limits extending the measurements of non-linear flow modes of f-meson for n > 4. The measurements show a significant increase in the magnitude of this non-linear flow mode with increasing centrality percentile. This is due to the fact that v5,32(pT) has a contribution from both e2 and e3. It is shown in MC studies that both e2 and e3 increase for peripheral collisions [?]. Although, this increase is less pronounced for e3. "

L344-348: Why is v6,222 missing for the decays? + explain briefly the expectation for v6,33 andv6,222 vs centrality based on the relevant dependence of ε2 and ε3


Answer: The correlators required for v_6,222 are d_6,222, a 4-particle correlator and c_222,222, a 6-particle correlator, in contrast to other mixed harmonics, where 4-particle correlator is needed in denominator. For V0s and phi the statistics needed for these correlators are simply not enough and we couldn't extend the measurements of V0s to v6,222.

Section 6.3: I think the paper is missing a punchline; this can be done in the section where thedata are compared with models. We should try to make a point on how good/bad the samemodels describe the total vn e.g. if they describe them better but fail here then the message isclear


Answer: You are absolutely right. I elaborated on this part, adding the study from total flow measurements and how the models described v_n. 
Now it reads: 

"Measurements of total flow coefficients at RHIC and LHC are described well by hydrodynamic calculations [53–55]. A recent comparison between total flow measurements at ALICE [19] and two hydrodynamic calculations from [55] shed new light on the initial conditions and the transport properties of the created system in Pb–Pb collisions. Both calculations are based on iEBE-VISHNU [56], an event-by-event version of the VISHNU hybrid model [57] coupling 2+1 dimensional viscous hydrodynamics (VISH2+1) [58] to a hadronic cascade model (UrQMD). The initial conditions used for these calculations are described by AMPT [59] and TRENTo [60] both with t0=0.6 fm/c and Tsw =148 MeV [61]. These values are obtained by using Bayesian statistics from a simultaneous fit of final charged-particle density,mean transverse momentum, and integrated total flow coefficients vn in Pb–Pb collisions at sNN = 2.76 TeV. For AMPT initial conditions, constant values of specific shear viscosity (eta/s = 0.08), the lower limit conjectured by AdS/CFT) and bulk viscosity (zeta/s = 0) are utilised, and TRENTo [60] initial conditions incorporates a temperature dependent specific shear and bulk viscosity. The comparison between the total flow measurements and these two calculations illustrates a qualitative agreement. This agreement between the data and the models depends on the particle species, transverse momentum range and centrality percentile and overall the AMPT model reproduces these measurements more accurately than TRENTo [19]."

*   Cosmetics for plots   *
***************************
In general all plots need to be enlarged in height
Fig. 2: did u try a 3x2 format? I would, in any case, expand the height of the plots
Fig. 3, 4: Maybe 3x2 or add height and move the legend to the 6th pad
Fig. 8: maybe try 3x2?
Fig. 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13: maybe 3x3?
Fig. 14: Modify it to look like the previous plots i.e. don’t have six separate pads with individual y-axis for example. I would also split the legends and not repeat them e.g. keep the “ALICE” legend on the top left, the “AMPT IC” legend on the top-middle and the “TRENTO-IC” on the top right.
