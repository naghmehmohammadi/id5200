The comparison between the total flow measurements and these two calculations illustrates a qualitative agreement. This agreement between the data and the models depends on the particle species, transverse momentum range and centrality percentile and overall the AMPT model reproduces these measurements more accurately than TRENTo [19].” ==> we need to go beyond the “qualitative nature” of this comparison; I feel we need to quantify i.e. are these models working better/worse for the total than the NL modes? And by how much? What does this tell us? Are models capable of describing the total flow coefficients better than the NL terms? If yes, we could probably make an additional point?


- Along the previous lines but more importantly since this is related to the data points, we need to be a bit more systematic in the way we report the main features of the NL terms i.e. mass ordering and the particle-type grouping and try to go one step further from just the observation. ==> Is this mass ordering more pronounced for the NL terms than the total flow? Maybe not (at least calculating things by eye), but please quantify! IS the particle type grouping holding better for the NL terms than the total flow? Maybe not (at least calculating things by eye), but please quantify!
