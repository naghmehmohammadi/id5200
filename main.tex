\begin{abstract}
\noindent The $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-differential non-linear flow modes, $v_{4,22}$, $v_{5,32}$, $v_{6,33}$ and $v_{6,222}$ for \pion, \kaon, \Ks, \proton, \lambdas~and $\phi$-meson have been measured for the first time at \sNN~in Pb--Pb collisions with the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The results were obtained with a multi-particle technique, correlating the identified hadrons with reference charged particles from a different pseudorapidity region. 
These non-linear observables probe the contribution from the second and third order initial spatial anisotropy coefficients to higher flow harmonics. All the characteristic features observed in previous $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-differential anisotropic flow measurements for various particle species are also present in the non-linear flow modes, i.e. increase of magnitude with increasing centrality percentile, mass ordering at low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and particle type grouping in the intermediate $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ range. Hydrodynamical calculations (iEBE-VISHNU) that use different initial conditions and values of shear and bulk viscosity to entropy density ratios are confronted with the data at low transverse momenta. These calculations exhibit a better agreement with the anisotropic flow coefficients than the non-linear flow modes. These observations indicate that non-linear flow modes can provide additional discriminatory power in the study of initial conditions as well as new stringent constraints to hydrodynamical calculations.
