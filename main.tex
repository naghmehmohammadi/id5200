\begin{abstract}
\noindent The $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-differential non-linear flow modes, $v_{4,22}$, $v_{5,32}$, $v_{6,33}$ and $v_{6,222}$ for \pion, \kaon, \Ks, \proton, \lambdas~and $\phi$-meson have been measured for the first time in Pb--Pb collisions at \sNN~with the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The results were obtained with a multi-particle technique, correlating the identified hadrons with reference charged particles from a different pseudorapidity region. %The second and third order anisotropic flow coefficients are mostly related to their corresponding initial spatial anisotropy. It has been shown that higher harmonics ($n > 3$) have significant contribution from lower order flow harmonics giving rise to non-linear flow modes in the higher flow harmonics. Thus, 
These non-linear observables probe the contribution from the second and third order initial spatial anisotropy coefficients to higher flow harmonics. All the characteristic features observed in previous $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-differential anisotropic flow measurements for various particle species are also present in the non-linear flow modes, i.e. increase of magnitude with increasing centrality percentile, mass ordering at low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and particle type grouping in the intermediate $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ range. Hydrodynamical calculations (iEBE-VISHNU) that use different initial conditions and values of shear and bulk viscosity to entropy density ratios are confronted with the data at low transverse momenta. These calculations exhibit a better agreement with the anisotropic flow coefficients than the non-linear flow modes. These observations indicate that non-linear flow modes can provide additional discriminatory power in the study of initial conditions as well as new stringent constraints to hydrodynamical calculations.


%This comparison provides additional discriminatory power in the study of initial conditions as well as new stringent constraints to hydrodynamical calculations.

%The results for \pT~$< 3$ \GeV~are confronted with hydrodynamical model (iEBE-VISHNU) that uses two different initial conditions, one generated by A Multi-Phase Transport model (AMPT) which describes the expansion of the fire using a specific shear viscosity ($\eta/s$) of 0.08 and specific bulk viscosity ($\zeta/s$) of zero, coupled to a hadronic cascade model (UrQMD) and the other generated by TRENTo (Reduced Thickness Event-by-event Nuclear Topology) which uses a temperature dependent specific shear and bulk viscosity.
