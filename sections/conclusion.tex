\section{Summary}
\label{Sec:conclusion}

In this article, the measurements of the non-linear flow modes, $v_{4,22}$, $v_{5,32}$, $v_{6,222}$ and $v_{6,33}$ are for the first time reported as a function of transverse momentum for different particle species, i.e. \pion, \kaon, \Ks, \proton, \lambdas~and $\phi$-meson. The results are presented in a wide range of centrality intervals from 0--5\% up to 50--60\% in Pb--Pb collisions at \sNN. The magnitude of the non-linear flow modes, $v_{\rm n,mk}$, were obtained with a multi-particle correlation technique, namely the generic framework, selecting the identified hadron under study and the reference flow particles from different, non-overlapping pseudorapidity regions.  

The measured $v_{4,22}$, $v_{5,32}$ and $v_{6,222}$ exhibit a distinct centrality dependence. This centrality dependence originates from the contribution of initial state eccentricity, $\varepsilon_{2}$, as shown in Eq. \ref{Eq:V4V5V6}. As expected, $v_{6,33}$ does not exhibit a considerable centrality dependence since $\varepsilon_{3}$ quantifies primarily the event-by-event fluctuations of the initial energy density profile. This is supported by the relatively large magnitude of $v_{6,33}$ in the most-central collisions (0--5\%). A clear mass ordering is observed in the low \pT~region (\pT$< 2.5$ \GeV). A closer comparison between $v_{4}$ and $v_{4,22}$ shows that this mass ordering seems slightly larger for $v_{4,22}$ than $v_{4}$ at very low \pT~(\pT<0.8 \GeV). 
In the intermediate \pT~region (\pT$> 2.5$ \GeV), a particle type grouping is observed where the magnitude of the non-linear modes for baryons is larger than for mesons similar to observations in $v_{n}$ measurements. The NCQ scaling holds at an approximate level of $\pm 20$\% within the current level of statistical and systematic uncertainties, similar to that of the anisotropic flow coefficients \cite{Acharya:2018zuq}. 

The comparison of two models based on the iEBE-VISHNU hybrid model, with two different initial conditions (AMPT and \trento) and transport properties shows that neither of the models is able to fully describe the measurements. The quality of the model description depends on the centrality percentile and particle species similar to the model-data comparisons of the anisotropic flow coefficients \cite{Acharya:2018zuq}. The measurements are better predicted by the models in more central collisions. All in all, the model using AMPT initial conditions ($\eta/s = 0.08$ and $\zeta/s =0$) exhibits a magnitude and shape closer to the measurements. As a result, in order to further constrain the values of the transport properties and the initial conditions of the system, it is necessary to tune the input parameters of future hydrodynamic calculations attempting to describe these measurements.
