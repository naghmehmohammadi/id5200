\section{Results and discussion}
\label{Sec:Results}

In this section, the results for the \pT-dependent non-linear flow modes $v_{4,22}$, $v_{5,32}$, $v_{6,33}$ and $v_{6,222}$ of identified particles are presented for various centrality intervals in Pb--Pb collisions at \sNN. We first present the centrality and \pT~dependence of $v_{n,mk}$ in Sec. \ref{SubSec:pTdependence}. Scaling properties of non-linear flow modes are discussed in Sec. \ref{subsection:NCQscaling} and comparisons to two model calculations are shown in Sec. \ref{SubSec:hydro}. Note that the same data are used in different representations to highlight the physics implications of the measurements in each section.

\subsection{Centrality and \pT~dependence of non-linear flow modes}
\label{SubSec:pTdependence}

Higher order flow coefficients ($n>3$) are mainly generated by inhomogeneities in the initial density profile, the collision geometry as well as the non-linear hydrodynamic response of the system. Figure \ref{v422_centralityDependence} presents the non-linear term for the fourth order flow coefficient, i.e. $v_{4,22}(p_{\rm{T}})$, of \pion, \kaon, \proton, \lambdas, \Ks~and $\phi$-meson for a wide range of centrality intervals, i.e. 0-60\%. For the $\phi$-meson, the results are reported in the 10-50\% centrality interval, where $v_{4,22}$ can be measured accurately. The magnitude of $v_{4,22}$ rises steeply with increasing centrality interval from 0-5\% to 40-50\% for all particle species. This increase is expected as $v_{4,22}$ measures the contribution of the second order eccentricity, $\varepsilon_{2}$, in $v_{4}$ and the eccentricity of
the overlap region of the colliding nuclei increases for peripheral collisions. For more peripheral collisions (i.e. 50-60\%) , the magnitude of $v_{4,22}$ is smaller than in the previous centrality intervals for all particle species. This is probably due to the shorter lifetime of the produced system in more peripheral collisions, which stops $v_{4,22}$ from developing further.

Figure \ref{v523_centralityDependence} presents the non-linear term for the fifth order flow coefficient, i.e. $v_{5,32}(p_{\rm{T}})$, of \pion, \kaon, \proton, \lambdas~and \Ks~for the same range of centrality intervals, i.e. 0-60\%. Statistical precision
limits extending the measurements of non-linear flow modes of $\phi$-meson for $n>4$. The measurements show a significant increase in the magnitude of this non-linear flow mode with increasing centrality percentile. Similar to $v_{4,22}$, this trend was expected due to the contribution of the second order eccentricity, $\varepsilon_{2}$.

Figure \ref{v633_centralityDependence} and \ref{v6222_centralityDependence} present the non-linear terms for the sixth order flow coefficient, i.e. $v_{6,33}(p_{\rm{T}})$ for \pion, \kaon, \proton, \lambdas~and \Ks~at 0-50\% centrality intervals and $v_{6,222}(p_{\rm{T}})$ for \pion, \kaon, \proton~at 0-60\% centrality intervals. As expected, measurements of $v_{6,222}(p_{\rm{T}})$ show an increase in the magnitude of this non-linear flow mode with increasing centrality percentile, whereas, $v_{6,33}(p_{\rm{T}})$ presents little to no dependence on centrality.

%\subsection{Mass ordering}
%\label{MassOrdering}

In Fig. \ref{v422_particleDependence} the same data points are grouped by centrality interval to highlight how $v_{4,22}$ develops for a given centrality for various particle species as a function of \pT.
%Figures \ref{v422_particleDependence} presents the \pT-differential $v_{4,22}$ for \pion, \kaon, \proton, \Ks, \lambdas~and $\phi$-meson starting from most central collisions (0-5\%) up to the 50-60\% centrality interval. 
A clear mass ordering can be seen in the low \pT~region (i.e. \pT $< 2.5$ \GeV) at all collision centralities. This mass dependence arises from the interplay between the non-linear response of the system and radial flow. Radial flow creates a depletion in the particle spectra at lower \pT~values which leads to lower $v_{4,22}$ for heavier particles.

\caption{The \pT-differential $v_{4,22}$ for different particle species grouped into different centrality intervals of Pb--Pb collisions \sNN}
\label{v422_particleDependence}
\end{figure}

Similarly, Figs. \ref{v523_particleDependence}, \ref{v633_particleDependence} and \ref{v6222_particleDependence} show the \pT-differential $v_{5,32}$, $v_{6,33}$ and $v_{6,222}$ respectively, of different particle species for each centrality interval. A clear mass ordering is seen in the low \pT~region, (i.e. \pT $< 2.5$ \GeV), for $v_{5,32}(p_{\rm{T}})$, $v_{6,33}(p_{\rm{T}})$ and $v_{6,222}(p_{\rm{T}})$, which similarly arises from the interplay between the non-linear response of the system and radial flow.

\newpage

In addition, in the intermediate \pT~region (for \pT $> 2.5$ \GeV) the data points of Figs. \ref{v422_particleDependence}-\ref{v6222_particleDependence} exhibit a particle type grouping. In particular, mesons (\pion, \kaon, \Ks~and $\phi$) and baryons (\proton~and \lambdas) group based on their type with $v_{n,mk}$ of baryons having a larger magnitude. This particle type grouping was previously seen in the anisotropic flow measurements \cite{Abelev:2014pua,Adam:2016nfo,Acharya:2018zuq,Adams:2003am,Abelev:2007qg,Adler:2003kt,Adare:2006ti} triggering the development of calculations relying on coalescence. As a next step it was suggested to use a form of number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling in which both flow coefficients and \pT~were scaled by the number of constituent quarks ($n_{q}$). This scaling, worked initially at RHIC energies, although later measurements revealed sizeable deviations from a perfect scaling \cite{Adams:2003am,Abelev:2007qg,Adler:2003kt,Adare:2006ti}. Recently, ALICE measurements showed that the NCQ scaling at LHC energies holds at best at an approximate level of 20\% for $v_{n}$ \cite{Abelev:2014pua,Adam:2016nfo,Acharya:2018zuq}. Various theoretical ideas were created to address the origin of possible scaling by requiring quark coalescence to be the dominant particle production mechanism in the intermediate \pT~region, where the hydrodynamic evolution of the fireball is not the driving force behind the development of anisotropic flow \cite{Voloshin:2002wa,Molnar:2003ff}.

\subsection{Test of scaling properties}
\label{subsection:NCQscaling}

Figures \ref{v422_NCQ}, \ref{v523_NCQ}, \ref{v633_NCQ} and \ref{v6222_NCQ} present $v_{4,22}$, $v_{5,32}$, $v_{6,33}$ and $v_{6,222}$ respectively, scaled by the inverse of number of constituent quarks ($n_{q}$) as a function of \pTnq~for \pion, \kaon, \proton, \Ks, \lambdas~and $\phi$-meson grouped in different centrality intervals. The scaling is consistent with the observations reported for higher order total flow coefficients \cite{Acharya:2018zuq}. Similarly, for non-linear modes this scaling hold at best at an approximate level ($\pm$20\%).

\subsection{Comparison with models}
\label{SubSec:hydro}

Measurements of total flow coefficients at RHIC and LHC are described well by the hydrodynamic calculations \cite{Xu:2016hmp, McDonald:2016vlt, Zhao:2017yhj}. Recently, it was shown that the \pT-integrated non-linear flow modes are good observables to constrain the initial conditions and transport properties of the system \cite{Acharya:2017zfg}. To further test the validity of these hydrodynamic models a comparison is performed between the measured non-linear flow modes and two hydrodynamical calculations from \cite{Zhao:2017yhj}.  Both calculations are based on iEBE-VISHNU \cite{Shen:2014vra}, an event-by-event version of the VISHNU hybrid model \cite{Song:2010aq} coupling $2+1$~dimensional viscous hydrodynamics (VISH2+1) \cite{Song:2007fn} to a hadronic cascade model (UrQMD). One of these models uses AMPT \cite{Lin:2004en} initial conditions with constant values of specific shear viscosity ($\eta/s =0.08$, the lower limit conjectured by AdS/CFT) and bulk viscosity ($\zeta/s = 0$), and the other model incorporates TRENTo \cite{Moreland:2014oya} initial conditions with a temperature dependent specific shear and bulk viscosity. For simplicity in the rest of this article the model with AMPT initial conditions, $\eta/s =0.08$ and $\zeta/s =0$ is referred to as AMPT and the model with TRENTo initial conditions, $\eta/s(\rm{T})$ and $\zeta/s(\rm{T})$ is referred to as TRENTo. 

Figures \ref{v422_model}, \ref{v523_model}, \ref{v633_model} and \ref{v6222_model} present the comparison between the measurements (data points in the plots) and both models for the \pT-differential $v_{4,22}$, $v_{5,32}$, $v_{6,33}$ and $v_{6,222}$, respectively, for \pion, \kaon~and \proton~at 0-10\% up to 50-60\% centrality interval (40-50\% centrality interval for $v_{6,33}$) of Pb--Pb collisions at \sNN. The solid bands show the AMPT model and the hatched bands represent the TRENTo calculations. The bottom panels in each plot in Figs. \ref{v422_model}, \ref{v523_model}, \ref{v633_model} and \ref{v6222_model} present the difference between the models and the measurement. Both models produce a mass ordering in $p_{\rm{T}}<2.5$ \GeV. The comparison between the models and the the measurements of $v_{4,22}$ reveals that in more central collisions they reproduce the data however as centrality decreases the models start to deviate from the data. This pattern repeats for $v_{5,32}$ in which AMPT reproduces the data relatively better. The comparison between the measurements and the models  for $v_{6,222}$ and $v_{6,33}$ shows that the models are able to reproduce the data only up to 30-40\% and 20-30\% centrality intervals, respectively. 


%The comparisons show slightly better agreement between the data and the model which uses AMPT as the initial conditions but both models need to be tuned to data further to describe these sensitive flow modes.
